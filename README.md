## TODO
### Crucial
- add data for each job
- Finish tweaking resume area styles
- print mode
- ~~favicons~~
- Browser review [wip]
  ~~- Buggy flashing around bottom of header area on Desktop Safari & FF~~
- Social share cards
- Audit keyboard nav [wip]
  - Did this initially but want to double check after all content entered
- Audit VoiceOver [wip]
  - Did this initially and it passes, but I want to make improvements, for example, footer is read as contentinfo and 
    there's prob a more appropriate role...?
- ~~check prettier, eslint?~~
- Ensure 404s redirect to home
- Ask Kevin to check real Android experience and icon on his phone
- PageSpeed Insights
- SEO / get indexed
- Review repo settings, readme, GitHub profile

### Nice to have
- Light mode? (Doesn't make a ton of sense because large parts of the page will always be light and large parts will always be dark?)
- More robust TypeScript explorations?
- Structured data
- IDE highlighting fixes
- Review wierd devices like apple watch?
- Update and add link to wp.org profile
