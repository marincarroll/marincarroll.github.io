## TODO

### Crucial

~~- add data for each job~~
~~- Finish tweaking resume area styles~~
~~- print mode~~
~~- favicons~~
  ~~- Buggy flashing around bottom of header area on Desktop Safari & FF~~
~~- Social share cards~~
- set up the URL I've already owned for a million years
- Browser review [wip]
- Audit of keyboard nav [wip]
- Audit VoiceOver [wip]
- ~~check prettier, eslint?~~
- ~~Ensure 404s redirect to home~~
  - Don't love how GitHub pages says 'Redirecting to...' when 404ing
- Ask Kevin to check real Android experience and icon on his phone
- PageSpeed Insights
- SEO / get indexed
- Review repo settings, readme, GitHub profile

### Nice to have
- Light mode? (Doesn't make a ton of sense because large parts of the page will always be light and large parts will always be dark?)
- Markdown setup for content instead of JSON
- Set up more robust TypeScript
  - resume.d.ts is doing nothing right now
- Structured data
- IDE highlighting fixes
- Review wierd devices like apple watch?
- Are custom cursors and scrollbars truly so awful?
- Update and add link to wp.org profile
