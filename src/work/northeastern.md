Northeastern Global News is a high-traffic news & PR site (1m+ views per month). I create components to drive user engagement and improve publishing flow while continually maintaining a large codebase.
This year I worked on:

- Spearheading an initiative to ensure analytics tags' GDPR compliance, using GTM & TrustArc.
- Using Adobe Target to create A/B tests and serve personalized content.
- Creating interactive news features using GSAP animations and scrollytelling.
- Building complex custom Gutenberg blocks (graphics & media, interactive widgets, recommended content) to improve user engagement.
