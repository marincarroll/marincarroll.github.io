This year I worked on:

- Spearheading an initiative to ensure analytics tags' GDPR compliance, using GTM & TrustArc.
- Using Adobe Target to create A/B tests and serve personalized content w/the Delivery API.
- Creating interactive news features using GSAP animations, video content, and scrollytelling.
- Building complex custom Gutenberg blocks (graphics & media, interactive widgets, recommended content) to improve user engagement with news stories.
