Lead the developer team at a creative web agency building greenfield sites (mostly WordPress, occasionally Shopify), specializing in biotech. Most projects involved custom block development (React), integrating 3rd-party REST APIs, and GSAP animations/scrollytelling. This role was client-facing and involved a bit of UI design.
